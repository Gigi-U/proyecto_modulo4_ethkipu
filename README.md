# Swappme-Dex: Decentralized Exchange Front-End üöÄ

Welcome to *Swappme-Dex*, a user-friendly front-end application designed to interact seamlessly with three smart contracts: **SimpleDEX**, **TokenA**, and **TokenB**. These contracts were developed by [@Gigi-U](https://www.github.com/Gigi-U) as part of my learning journey at **Eth Kipu**, an institution focused on blockchain education. This platform allows you to easily manage liquidity and perform token swaps on the Ethereum blockchain. Built with Scaffold-ETH and designed for ease of use, Swappme-Dex provides the tools to exchange tokens and manage liquidity with a clean and responsive UI.
